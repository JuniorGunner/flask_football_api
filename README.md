# Football Data API :soccer:

This project is designed to create a REST API that interacts with the Football-data.org API, imports the data locally to a MongoDB database, and exposes endpoints for fetching the said data. 

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- üêç **Python** - Chosen for its simplicity and readability, making the code easy to write and maintain.
- üå∂Ô∏è **Flask** - A lightweight and versatile micro web framework suitable for small to medium applications.
- üçÉ **MongoDB** - A popular NoSQL database, known for its scalability and flexibility when dealing with large amounts of data and complex software applications.
- üê≥ **Docker** - Simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and running applications using containers. It enables developers to package an application and its dependencies into a single container.

## Getting Started :rocket:

### Prerequisites:
- Ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.

### Running the project:

1. First of all, clone this repository;

2. Make sure to get a personal token for test on [Football Data API](https://www.football-data.org/client/register);

3. Add your token to API_TOKEN environment variable:
```
export API_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

3. Build and run the project using docker-compose:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

4. Once the server is running, you can access the API at http://localhost:5000.

For a better experince test it using Postman or other tool of your preference.

### Testing the endpoints :test_tube:

1. First of all, hit `/import-league/\<leagueCode\>` - it will import all data for the league code on the path parameter (leagues used on this test: PD, CL, PL);
2. Once everything was imported, you'll see the following message `"Imported league data for league code: {leagueCode}"`;
3. After that, the data will be on your MongoDB instance. You can check it directly through MongoDB Compass (or other MongoDB tool of your preference) and accessing the endpoints listed below;

API Endpoints :link:

* /import-league/\<leagueCode\> (P.S.: Use only once yo import data and save on MongoDB)
* /players/\<leagueCode\>
* /team/\<teamName\>
* /players-of-team/\<teamName\>
